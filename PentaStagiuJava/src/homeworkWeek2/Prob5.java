/*
 Write a program that test whether 2 int arrays are equal. Equality in this case means that both arrays have the same number of elements an element on a specific index in first array is equal to the element on the same index in the second array.

For example

For the following arrays [1,2,3,4] and [1,2,3,4] the output should be TRUE
For the following arrays [] and [] the output should be TRUE
For the following arrays [1,3,2] and [1,3] the output should be FALSE
For the following arrays [1,2,3,4] and [1,2,4,3] the output should be FALSE
